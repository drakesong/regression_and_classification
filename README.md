# Film Production Company (Regression and Classification)

#### CS 347 Machine Learning Project 3
#### Drake Song
#### Fall Semester 2017, Professor Kathryn Leonard


###### Project description:
Using classification and regression models of Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines, predict rating (above 7.5 or not), rank (which 100s level), and revenue of a film using performance data of past movies.

###### How to run:
1. Required files:
    * cleanData.m
    * IMDBMovieData.mat
    * MLApp.m
    * predictRank.m
    * predictRank_DT.m
    * predictRank_LR.m
    * predictRank_SVM.m
    * predictRating.m
    * predictRating_DT.m
    * predictRating_LR.m
    * predictRating_SVM.m
    * predictRev.m
    * predictRev_DT.m
    * predictRev_SVM.m
    * project3.m
    * rankMdl.mat
    * ratingMdl.mat
    * revMdl.mat
    * topactors.mat
    * topdirectors.mat
    <br><br>
2. Using MatLab, run *project3.m*

###### What to expect:
1. There will be comments displayed on the Command Window as the code runs
2. The following events will occur in order:
    * Adjust data so that they can actually be used for analysis
    * Predict ratings of movies using Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and
    Support Vector Machine
    * Predict rankings of movies using Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and
    Support Vector Machine
    * Predict revenues of movies using Decision Trees and Support Vector Machine
    * Predict all of above using Machine Learning Toolkit from MatLab
