# Film Production Company

## Project Description:
Using classification and regression models of Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines, predict rating (above 7.5 or not), rank (which 100s level), and revenue of a film using performance data of past movies.

## Models:
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Trees
* SVM

## What To Expect:
1. There will be comments displayed on the Command Window as the code runs
2. The following events will occur in order:
    * Adjust data so that they can actually be used for analysis
    * Predict ratings of movies using Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and
    Support Vector Machine
    * Predict rankings of movies using Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and
    Support Vector Machine
    * Predict revenues of movies using Decision Trees and Support Vector Machine
    * Predict all of above using Machine Learning Toolkit from MatLab
